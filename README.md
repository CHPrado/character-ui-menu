# Character UI

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

In this game you can chose one of three paragon characters by using an interactive menu. In this menu you can check each of the characters abilities descriptions and attributes. It is also possible to update a few of the attributes and it will be stored and loaded when you come back to the menu.

# How the game works

- press the "I" key to access the menu;
- navigate between the characters pressing "2" and "1" keys;
- click on the attributes / abilities button to change tabs for more information;
- press "I" key again to close the menu and play the chosen character;
